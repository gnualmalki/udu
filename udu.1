.SH NAME
udu \- fast disk usage analyzer with parallel directory traversal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B udu
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIPATH\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B udu
recursively examines directory hierarchies and prints their space usage.  It
uses a parallel directory walker implemented with OpenMP to increase throughput
on systems with multiple processors.
.PP
If no \fIPATH\fR is specified, the current directory is processed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-apparent\-size
Print the apparent size of files.  Apparent size is the byte count reported by
the filesystem and may differ from allocated disk blocks, especially for sparse
files.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display a summary of usage and exit.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Print output only after processing all input.  This is the default.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-tree
Display directory contents in a tree structure with visual branch indicators.
Directories are shown with a trailing slash and are listed before files.
When combined with \fB\-v\fR, file sizes are displayed alongside each entry.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Print each processed file.
.TP
.BR --version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-X ", " \-\-exclude=\fIPATTERN\fR
Skip files whose names match \fIPATTERN\fR.  This option may be given multiple
times.  Patterns use the usual shell-style globbing rules:
.RS
.TP
.B *
Match any string.
.TP
.B ?
Match any single character.
.TP
.B [abc]
Match any one of the characters listed.
.TP
.B [0-9]
Match any digit in the range.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B udu
Process the current directory.
.TP
.B udu \-a ~/
Display apparent sizes in the home directory.
.TP
.B udu \-t /etc
Display the directory tree structure for /etc.
.TP
.B udu \-tv ~/projects
Show a verbose tree view with file sizes for the projects directory.
.TP
.B udu \-v \-X '*.log' /var
Verbose scan while excluding log files.
.TP
.B udu /home /var \-X 'temp?' \-X '[0-9]*.bak'
Scan several paths and exclude temporary and numbered backup files.
.TP
.B udu ~/ \-avX epstein-files
Scan the home directory with verbose and apparent-size modes enabled, excluding a specific directory.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Program completed successfully.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred; for example, an invalid option, a missing file, or a
permission failure.
.SH PERFORMANCE
.B udu
performs parallel directory traversal using OpenMP.  Performance improves with
the number of available processors and with directory trees containing many
branches.  On multi-processor systems it typically outperforms the traditional
.BR du (1)
utility.
.SH NOTES
Symbolic links are followed, but link targets are not counted more than once.
Special files (device nodes, FIFOs, sockets) are ignored when computing totals.
