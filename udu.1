.SH NAME
udu \- disk usage analyzer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]udu\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]]\&...
[\f[I]FILE\f[R]]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]udu\f[R] analyzes disk usage by scanning directory trees and
computing the total space consumed by files and directories.
When built with OpenMP support, it parallelizes directory traversal
across multiple cores to accelerate analysis of large filesystem
hierarchies.
.PP
If no \f[I]FILE\f[R] is specified, \f[B]udu\f[R] processes the current
directory and all subdirectories recursively.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.PP
\f[B]\-a\f[R], \f[B]\[en]apparent\-size\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; the apparent size is
usually smaller than disk usage, but it can be larger due to holes in
sparse files, internal fragmentation, or indirect blocks
.PP
\f[B]\-h\f[R], \f[B]\[en]help\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
display this help and exit
.PP
\f[B]\-q\f[R], \f[B]\[en]quiet\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
suppress normal output; print only the final result (default)
.PP
\f[B]\-t\f[R], \f[B]\[en]tree\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
display output in tree format; directories are listed before files and
marked with a trailing slash
.PP
\f[B]\-v\f[R], \f[B]\[en]verbose\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
explain what is being done
.PP
\f[B]\[en]version\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
output version information and exit
.PP
\f[B]\-X\f[R], \f[B]\[en]exclude=\f[R]*PATTERN*
.PD 0
.P
.PD
exclude files that match \f[I]PATTERN\f[R]
.PP
\f[I]PATTERN\f[R] is a shell pattern (not a regular expression).
The pattern characters are:
.PP
\f[B]?\f[R] \[em] matches any single character
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[B]*\f[R] \[em] matches any string, including the empty string
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[B][\&...]\f[R] \[em] matches any one of the enclosed characters
.SH EXAMPLES
\f[B]udu\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Summarize disk usage of the current directory.
.PP
\f[B]udu \-a /home\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Summarize apparent size of /home.
.PP
\f[B]udu \-t /etc\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Display disk usage of /etc as a tree.
.PP
\f[B]udu \-X `*.o' src/\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Summarize src/ but exclude object files.
.PP
\f[B]udu /home /var \-X temp \-X cache\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Summarize two directories while excluding temp and cache.
.SH PATTERNS
The \f[B]\-X\f[R] (or \f[B]\[en]exclude\f[R]) option uses shell pattern
matching.
Patterns match against the full path being examined.
.PP

\f[B]glob\f[R](7).
